# 🖨️ The500XY (WIP)
**500x500 Open-Source CoreXY Printer Based on Rook 2020**

## 🔥 About

Around **December 2024**, I kicked off my 3D printing business. I needed machines — a lot of them.  
And since I’ve been building printers since the **Prusa i2** era, I figured:  
> *“Screw it, let’s build something big.”*

That’s how **LanternXY** was born — a basic CoreXY printer.  
But I never made it public because, let’s be honest, it just wasn’t sturdy enough.  
Good idea, not-so-good frame.

**So I rebuilt it**. I used the awesome open-source **Rook 2020** design as the base, improved the rigidity,  
and gave it a new name and identity: **The500XY**.
